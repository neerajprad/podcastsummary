Okay so today we are going to take a look at the NASDAQ 100 sell-off in this month of August and how that is being driven out of Asia specifically China. Before we do that we're going to go over again how the NDX index basically got up there in the first place for it to sell off from and indeed I'm making a call that what we are seeing right now is the top for the NDX at least for the time being and is being driven out of market forces out of China. Now apologies I am having some technical difficulties with some of my charts and other clips that I want to use too because I was gonna originally discuss what's going on with Country Garden China's largest property developer you know once upon a time it was four times more projects than Levergrande and all that basically default risk halting 10 onshore bonds becoming a penny stock last week 50% down month date 18% down you know on the day as well as like three trillion dollar shadow banking and like trust and wealth management industry in China. Those things are very important they're very very important obviously I wouldn't be even flagging them right now so I will get back to them but for today I'm just gonna show you green and red blinking tickers version of the picture of US equity markets okay and the sell-off that is happening in the US equity markets and the very general broad thesis is the reason that the NASDAQ is up on the year spectacularly up on the year is because of Japan equity markets the reason that it's currently crashing right now is because of China okay very straightforward I'm gonna show you the NDX futures that's like 100 index futures price action during Asia trading session first of all why did NDX futures suddenly sell off nearly 1% starting around 930 a.m. Japan time well let's see what Japan equities were doing okay so here's the Nikkei 225 cash index overlaid in white and as you can see at 9 a.m. Japan cash equity open the Nikkei actually rises for the first half hour of trading then at around 930 a.m. dollar yen breaks above 145 and then that triggers a Nikkei sell-off that lasts into a.m. session close and then continues throughout the p.m. session to close at session lows and as you can see all the while dragging the NASDAQ down alongside it okay obviously the NASDAQ 100 index doesn't care about dollar yen levels it's merely moving alongside whatever the Nikkei is doing okay so various that's very simple now how about the afternoon as like futures during the age afternoon session where first of all we get this very sharp drop then followed by recovery rally to the upside this sort of like almost like a mini blow off top on volume what's that all about first of all let's shift the time zone back an hour and set it to Hong Kong China and then let's overlay the Hang Seng cash index on top and look at that at 12 noon Hong Kong or Hong Kong cash equity a.m. session close there is a drop in the Hang Seng index and that took the NDX down with it and then you get a p.m. session recovery back to cash open levels on the Hang Seng and that market on close by momentum into Hong Kong cash close at 4 p.m. that had uplifted NASDAQ futures alongside it in fact it caused a nearly 1% runaway spike on NDX futures on escalating volume within the last 10 minutes of the hang Hong Kong p.m. session okay so that's what happened why the sell-off Japan equities in the a.m. session sell-off why the rebound of blow off top Hong Kong p.m. session recovery and market on close so that's what happened to the NASDAQ 100 index futures overnight for those who are not in my time zone completely driven by and blindly following what Japan and Hong Kong and China markets are doing okay so then the next obvious question is well what's driving Japan and Hong Kong markets then that's therefore driving the NASDAQ that's why the market depth podcast exists so let's talk to currency pairs that are on the respective brings of being saved or getting hammered these are separate matters but they're coinciding and timing and therefore they affect one another and these would be the two worst currencies against the dollar-a-year date and that would be the Japanese yen and the Chinese Yuan all right so let's just talk about yen first so normally as you know we look at nominal yield spreads or real yield spreads for dollar yen price action you know explanations but after the july bank Japan meeting that basically threw a bucket of you know used mop water all over that whole mechanism mechanism it's basically been you know just a complete useless mess although it's now normalizing back to kind of yield spreads if not normalized by now for now because remember JGB yields are extremely unpredictable in yield curve control control the current era that we're in the new era and the bank Japan and markets are still in the very early innings of price agreement or price discovery procedural agreement hashing out processes to determine if a particular JGB at a particular level is a buy or a sell or a buy it all or a sell it all right so with regards to the yen for today's commentary I'm just gonna show you two angles that I don't really discuss much but are currently relevant in terms of price action first one is crude oil crude oil and yen now I do mention this sometimes you know again I just talk about like when they when crude and the yen correlate they really correlate even if it's temporary and obviously that's always temporary nothing's permanent and by correlate I mean just to the upside it's never really to the downside for crude versus dollar yen but this chart is basically from the end of last week when dollar yen really started pushing ever closer to this like 145 where we hit earlier that like push towards the end of the week that was truly an energy rally push on dollar yen up you know dollar up and yen down and this particular correlation of dollar yen and you know and energy prices it's this isn't the usual like kind of independent and coincidental phenomenon that I talked about right because this can be literal direct flow related from like a commercial trading sense particularly when market participants who aren't in the producer importer game you know when those people like me I suppose aren't in their offices speculating on futures solely for like financial zero intention to deliver nor take delivery of barrels of crude oil or LNG or gasoline or whatever when people like us are basically caught out because it's summer or whatever and trading volume is lighter from the speculator community and you get day to day import demand activity from you know an import dependent DM like Japan going through an extremely hot summer currently then you're literally seeing yen convert to dollars to buy energy priced in dollars energy imports price dollars thereby pushing both energy prices up and dollars up and yes I'm aware of the Australian strikes this chart actually predates that but this is a factor for the dollar-yen upside at the moment it's not the factor but it's a factor to point out just to give a heads up on small of a price contributor as it may be okay second thing I want to check in on was to see if the short yen trade was still an expression of a Fed trade and you know a pure Fed trade in which like the assumption is that the BOJ is just still a static policy standstill central bank and the Fed is a relatively policy you know diverging leg of the policy trade and so therefore you short the yen if your view is for a hawkish Fed and vice versa and it seems to be that it's pretty much back to being intact for the moment that short yen being a Fed play as you can see here okay because these are yen futures versus three months September 2024 sulfur futures which is basically like Fed funds futures equivalent and so when silver futures are selling off in direction moving downwards as you see here those are FOMC rate hikes being priced in and when silver futures are directionally rallying okay that's FOMC rate cuts or existing rate hike expectations being removed and as you can see it's pretty well correlated with the yen in the near term these are June 2024 expiry sulfur futures okay and here's yen futures versus same September 24s again this is that on a longer term price chart and you can see that mid-July you know this yen forced short cover on like weaker than expected non-payrolls that one Friday that I discussed and that yen divergence you know at the end of July start of August that's yen moving to the Bank of Japan obviously and thereby going rogue but not entirely so right the further out in expert you go with these like sulfur futures that are tracking kind of you know Fed policy the more that the price action on sulfur futures reflect even even just a hint even just a bit of Bank of Japan within Fed policy or so the market price action as you can see would suggest so see that late July to early August price action in these sulfur futures they kind of move alongside yen price action right there's no reason for the front end of the US rates curve to move at all directionally with the yen on a Bank of Japan shock policy shock unless markets are indeed reflecting this notion that perhaps major central bank policies especially that of the Bank of Japan perceived to be removing accommodation might have some bit of impact on other major central bank policies and if you think that's like a very nonsense notion that a you're probably like the American and B look at this this is December 2023 sulfur futures closer in date in expiry than the previous June and September 2024 so I show you and you can see that June 2023 FOMC policy is just going to be unmoved by what the Bank of Japan did in July no impact basically as reflected here okay that's the policy futures contracts that are not Bank of Japan impacted the near term FOMC meeting December 2023 but if you go out to 24 June 24 September 24 yeah they start to get impacted all right so the fact that these are behaving in this manner that would suggest that further out like over a year or so an FOMC policy that has some Bank of Japan factored into it what the particular view itself is I don't care I'm just showing you that traders are playing central bank policies as relatives to one another as well as reflected by these two instruments shorting the end short so for futures these are interconnected major global economies and of course major central banks don't live in isolation hence markets moving like so all right so here is spot dollar yen which breached that 145 level earlier why does that level matter the 145 91 that's where the Japan Ministry of Finance took unilateral direct foreign exchange market intervention measures on September 22nd basically smack dollar yen down from 146 to around like what 138 or something in an instant this is like 10 minutes after the September Bank of Japan Corotas press conference which was policy unchanged on yield curve control and so we're currently back to that 145 handle though we aren't getting a single word out of the Ministry of Finance as far kind of strange so that's smacking of dollar yen down simultaneously state interventionist support of both the JGB market and the currency market you know printing yen to buy yen well that didn't last very long as you can see yes yields continue to surge higher yields curve control meanwhile had kept JGB yields and so on October of 2022 Japan Ministry of Finance you know unilateral intervention number two of two dollar yen easily sliced into that 150 handle upwards and so the Ministry of Finance just sold something like 30 billion USD for dollar yen spot dollar yen reached 152 and that time US yields topped as well and then began this massive Exodus short covering as well as active buying that's why they need to defend the yen and that's why they need to do it here okay people say it's not the price level itself it's the velocity of the move I agree with the velocity of them you know the velocity of the move matters but the price level definitely matters as well okay and and for no other reason than just pure market you know basic market technicals okay cuz here's dollar yen long term this go back decades there's a real the Ministry of Finance kept dollar yen last October at 152 because 152 is a level that's already broken above the 1998 like three decade highs if you if you basically break that now the new highs would be what dollar yen 160 back in from 1990 and then do you know what's next after 160 dollar yen 260 so not that I think that they think that it would be like next up to 60 but let's not even find out how far we can get you know to what what the point is right just remember how crazy of a move this was in 2022 with dollar yen single-digit vol currency pair on a runaway momentum started in the first quarter of 2022 range bound at 115 then in eight months dollar yen went from 115 to 152 okay so if left unchecked yeah of course like dollar yen 200 by year end that was in sight so that brings us to the here and now okay what's my view on yent intervention first of all I'm very wary of these two prior yent ravines trigger levels but that's exactly what conduct the Ministry of Finance had implemented into our collective market heads he planted that that fear I know and it's working on me but I also don't think that they'll be acting upon those exact same levels if they were smart as in smart within the context of doing incredibly stupid things like getting involved with currency battling in the first place but if they were at all smart they would take the current Bank of Japan approach right there's no specific price level to defend on dollar yen those goalposts are always moving and we market participants shall never know where and when they'll act until it's being done in real time so Ministry of Finance shrouds itself in mystery right dollar yen keeps rallying they'll do another shocking intervention but maybe at a you know at a totally different price level perhaps that they'll do it in two rounds right one at like some new high say like 156 or whatever and then they'll do a follow-up far lower just to confuse people right maybe they'll even do it at the next uptick after blasting spot dollar yen down five big figures in 20 minutes for another five big figures down right or just something whatever is something just completely whatever it is it needs to be random and unpredictable and implant that into markets heads such that markets are always just confused afraid but here's my real current assessment I suppose of weak yen and FX management by Japan officials okay so the moment that the Bank of Japan rookie governor Ueda made a an honest but not good decision to say out loud at the last Bank of Japan press conference that the BOJ watches yen volatility which again is honest but that was not a smart move because in that moment the moment that that came out of his mouth now market participants are looking at the Bank of Japan as currency watchers and potentially currency defenders as well with their policy alongside if not for the moment in place of JGB yield defending meaning if dollar yen gets to what market participants feel it would be intervention levels it might be perceived that the Bank of Japan will be the body to fix yen higher or dollar yen lower by making a yield curve control tweak okay whether or not that actually is the case is irrelevant it doesn't matter what you are I think about that being stupid or not what matters is if enough market participants believe that that might be the new regime after that comment and certainly there is talk of that okay so those are my kind of you know leaves like the intervention thoughts now that we're at dollar yen 145 okay now on to the other Asia currency that's getting crushed at the moment that would be you want dollar CNH all right seven point three seven five on offshore dollar yuan is the level that must be held firm by the PBOC that's last year's highs because if that level is broken then we are now looking at dollar yuan levels not seen since 2007 and that would be a major problem followers of market depth are very well aware of what I've been discussing regarding China and their maintaining of you want stability or rather they're keeping the yuan from breaking new lows and in the immediate you know kind of all hands on deck economic policy priority it's the reason for an entire central bank leadership reshuffle right it is a primary reason for why they are not unleashing the massive stimulus that the PBOC has done before can do again if they so choose to they are not choosing to this is the reason as I explained you know in our previous episode this concept of like how you know emerging markets with dollar denominated debt getting killed by a strong dollar right just that general concept the conceptual explanation being like if you're a foreign entity if you borrow USD you effectively have a short dollar position open and a position that needs to be closed at some point right and so in the meantime if the dollar rises that's very bad for your short position just like any other short position and it gets ever more expensive for you to close out your position and if the dollar really rises then it could get even to the point where just like just like any short position you have unlimited potential losses right or at least losses that far exceed your ability to close out your short dollar trade so that's how that conceptually works and so Chinese entities currently you know have what like tens of billions in various dollar denominated debt outstanding facing maturity soon okay tens of billions that have that have shorted the dollar effectively and so if the dollar if dollar yuan breaks above that seven point three seven five level and to fifteen you know new fifteen year highs effectively what that means is that in a very oversimplified way anyone who in China who issued USD bonds or borrowed USD in the last fifteen years has to cover their short dollar position higher than where they opened it okay that's what's keeping the yuan from teetering off the cliff as the immediate urgent priority so that's why you just saw another 600 pip higher than expected yuan fix earlier this morning and yet that's not even working anymore because dollar yuan is now broken above seven seven and a quarter recall they did a 600 pips stronger move just recently and garnered success in doing so in yuan strengthening temporary as it was but for now PBOC's midpoint fixing for today was done over 600 pips higher and yet dollar yuan moves higher nonetheless ever close to that 15 year high here's yet another tool in their yuan arsenal apparently they're having commercial banks reveal details of who's selling forex you know selling yuan now as far as a particular article cited by quote people familiar with the matter who has not to be named you know they're not authorized to discuss this matter publicly yeah so I think this is clearly the the Chinese officials themselves and not some like forex anonymous like a whistleblower why would anyone leak this to the press and risk god knows what right because Chinese regulators they know who they're probing for FX activity and so if you get caught leaking this you're going to what tragically slip on a banana peel or something right what's the upside for in telling Bloomberg this heads up fellow market participants like the officials have their hands all over the yuan no nobody would do that okay and this is the type of article that Chinese currency officials tasked with keeping the yuan stable would love this is a deterrent like you think that they're angry that this is like out there like even if it weren't them directly which most certainly is but even if not if this intimidation measure is effective you might see the yuan stabilized temporarily if that's the case just know that markets are not no longer trying to sell yuan for USD anymore suddenly all right so this is how Asia markets are moving the Nasdaq okay how they have been how they currently are and how they will likely continue to in the immediate term and to the downside at that ie this August month to date drop in indices yes that's due to China okay but before the current China led Nasdaq downside let me first remind you of how the Nasdaq 100 index rallied from mid-April as it is and that would be due to Japan Japan drove the upside on NDX China is now pulling down the NDX okay but first let's see what happened with the Nikkei index in Japan versus the NDX futures correlation especially right here during this period this is NDX upside breakout lift thanks to foreign capital breaking the Nikkei above the key 30,000 level ceiling okay now I put out I put this out on Twitter recently so this is not like up to like the latest data so therefore follow me on Twitter at across the spread but top chart that's Nikkei futures and that's Nasdaq futures and Nikkei futures trading volume bottom half is Japan stock market investment by foreigners weekly net buy or sell data for which I said US traders watch Japan for NDX directional cues right because the Nasdaq's like sudden 15% upside from like May through July that began and moved in lockstep with the Nikkei and the topics indices in Japan breaking out to three decade highs starts with Warren Buffett endorsement of Japan equities you know then you start getting foreign investment inflows consecutive weeks again and again and again Nikkei breaks out to 30,000 finally through that ceiling that it was having such a hard time struggling 12 straight weeks of foreign net inflows right so either way what I was just saying is that note that the year-to-date massive you know best performer in equity markets is Japan but it's done with capital it's done with the US capital really right that's why I was saying that the Nikkei and the topics they might as well be like US indices and their downside that began on July 4th when the US was absent that's not really coincidental at all you also have earnings season that's underway you know short-term upside is a well priced in and now there's going to be my view be just be rapid profit-taking I'm not in my view it's been happening if you reported strong earnings thanks to week yen you're telling markets that your earnings driver has just is at its peak right now and so that's gonna lead to profit-taking all right but I want to focus on one particular time you know point in time here okay and that would be here this is the point where 12 straight weeks of inflows to Japan equities finally stopped just for week right but it was enough because that was the top in the Nikkei index and from that point forward to current that was a top for the Nikkei okay and by the way no the Nasdaq is not a major index that's it's a sector index so therefore doesn't count amongst major indices like the DAX or the Euro like Euro stocks KOSPI whatever okay okay so this boxed area here this is where the Nikkei took over the Nasdaq 100 which blindly followed the Nikkei's breakout up the upside you know to 30-year highs tick for tick tick for tick NDX had no reason to do this okay nor did Japan really for that matter other than you know getting the Warren Buffett endorsement but maybe that's why they're correlated in that time because they both don't deserve to be up here either way what that is in the Nikkei index is pushing it to these you know these like very high levels that is foreign capital like I said much of it is American capital that's pushing the Nikkei up up and up and that's also the same kind of capital that's you know going long five US mega cap tech stocks meaning that's I've explained numerous times before Japan is not only where the US and foreign international equity managers active capital is and not only therefore where the market driving is happening but Japan is also where the market breadth is okay if you're wondering where the US market breadth went it went to Japan alongside the capital and if you don't believe me why don't you go ask Stan Druckenmiller about current Japan equity market breadth relative to United States or just stand alone okay all right so the Nikkei and the Nasdaq 100 they're percent for percent take for tick 15% upside during that time until the end of June right but that moment that end of June moment that's key okay so let's dive into that moment because that's when the Nikkei tops and if similar dynamics are playing out as you'll see we might have the NDX top in as well and just continued downside that started from the beginning of August for the near term at the fair at least all right first of all let's see what else is correlated then and what else topped at that moment and how about the yen carry trade as represented by the Aussie yen carry trade and I explained this previously in market depth as well so I'm not going to do that now all point out is do you know when the Aussie yen peaked same time that Nikkei did back half of June as you can see here okay so let's just look from this peak moment forward to current okay what happened after this Nikkei peak and Aussie and peak and so on well first of all as you can see NDX didn't peak but the upside momentum first of all right at that spot that obviously hit a brick wall for a for a month because it's glued to the Nikkei price action this is why you need to pay attention to market depth either way after this point right that's when that tight correlation begins to unravel okay and so that's when the upside story of the NDX for 2023 kind of ends okay but the upside story is due to Japan now let's now talk about the what the downside story is and that is China and that is unfolding right now as we speak so same chart of NDX of the Nikkei and I've also added Hang Seng futures as well and that mid to late June peak moment that happened alongside a sudden flash rally in Hang Seng that turned into an immediately back down rally and crash right and plunged and gave up its gains but that spike that stopped three months of straight risk on momentum in both those indices same chart zoomed out US Japan Hong Kong equity indices and now I'm gonna add dollar yuan on top and this is an inverse charge it's dollar yuan inverse okay so notice dollar yuan and the Hang Seng they move in absolute lockstep for the first two-thirds of the chart and by the way going way back before this chart as well okay they're locked in tightly together the yellow and the red the Hang Seng and dollar yuan inverse that is until here this is rather strange the Hang Seng index just splits off from the yuan the yuan that continues to you know crash the Hang Seng however just does this series of like sharp temporary rallies and falls right but directionally just split apart apart from the yuan and it's in this period this sort of rogue like Hang Seng rallying period that that first spike in reversal top that was put into the Nikkei and the Nasdaq and Ozien and all that when the Hang Seng wasn't being accompanied by the yuan and the yuan just stayed the course downward it would have these momentary breakaways to the upside the Hang Seng but it always gravitated back to the direction of the currency which was downwards and when it did that it took down DM risk assets and indices in doing so now in a previous episode of market depth I explained how and why the Chinese yuan can correlate in price action with various various kinds of asset classes and markets and I explained how in 2022 in the year of 2022 there will be times where the US equity market would plunge and that would have absolutely nothing to do with the yuan or anything China related as evident by US equities falling and dollar yuan standing still as per these these arrows and then there are also instances in which US equities would sell off precisely due to the yuan and China as both plummet in tandem in fact the yuan had sold off in a significant material directional way on two separate occasions in the year 2022 and then once again what one more in the start of 2023 and but otherwise the currency has been more or less flat right but for each and every one of these these instances and that were the yuan would just go on a prolonged downside sell-off leg every single time it did that it took the US equity markets down with it the US equity markets were never immune from one of these sharp decisive yuan downside sell-offs again sometimes markets sell off on their own have nothing to do with China or the yuan and sometimes it has everything to do with China and the yuan and I got some news for you currently this is one of those times okay now it's kind of hard to visualize if you look at kind of a year to date chart but if we zoom in to the July to August period like this yeah the current sharp downside in Nasdaq from the start of August to current that is China and yuan driven just just look at the chart okay in fact if I add back the Nikkei index with this chart NDX is no longer loyal to the Nikkei as you can see in price action NDX follows the Nikkei to the upside but we're now in downside times and so the downside belongs to yuan downside for price action mirroring look at the most recent few days okay the Nikkei is on its own but NDX is just glued to that yuan plummet so back to this okay that mid-June spike in the Hang Seng as mentioned that put the top in Nikkei and certainly appears that at the end of July spike in Hang Seng seems that that put the top in the Nasdaq at least that is my current call so let's break down what's behind the Nasdaq I'm sorry let's break down what's behind the Hang Seng flow for the most recent spike and crash that potentially topped NDX as I am calling for here's the flow data of China a shares stock connect okay this is basically flows into and out of mainland China note that on July 24th that's the Politburo meeting day and you get outflow right but then that's followed by the next day by a huge surge of 18 billion yuan the next day of inflows into into Chinese stocks and that then basically net inflows every single day until the end of the month and this was not just short covering this was new longs this is foreigners that are rushing in right they believe the Chinese Communist Party's soothing words and promises not realizing that there is no stimulus coming material stimulus because currency stabilization is the only thing that matters right now okay but nonetheless the Hang Seng rallies sharply just like in June catalyzed by what they wanted to imagine that they heard of out of the Politburo meetings and meeting leaks or whatever and here are the hedge funds that tried to short China that got chopped up it's just something I've always said as well that I don't do I don't touch Chinese Chinese equities in either direction for this exact reason okay but look fast hedge fund de-grossing since 2021 Jesus okay so that's what happened and then this happened and now hedge funds who went long they got to enjoy like a week or two of the gear gains and now they're getting crushed seriously it's like pathetic this is like FOMO retail trading behavior this is China hedge funds that are liquidating and if you look at this this is amusing the smallest funds in the AUM they actually have the best returns because they're not institutionalized they're more nimble and so down goes the Nasdaq with the China downside all right and look here I've even superimposed that daily stock connect you know net flow chart you can see capital in price up capital out price down all right so again in June the Hang Seng breaks away from the Yuan directionally and rallies alongside the Nikkei index which has been uplifting the Nasdaq the Hang Seng has a sharp reversal down subsequently and that puts the top into the Nikkei index this is incredible year-to-day rally as well as in things like Ozien as well as stopping NDX momentum dead in its tracks then in late July the Hang Seng strikes again this time coming for NDX we get Hang Seng rally on CCP policy promises and words and promises that don't do anything for green and red blinking tickers and as per the immediate reversal yet again selling off and that put the top in for NDX or so goes my view and observations and analysis so watch the Chinese currency and Japanese stock markets the United States stock market does not drive itself in 2023 upside has been driven out of Japan downside is now being driven by China and if you need help or insights as to what's moving markets out of Asia well that's what I'm here for with market depth all right so that is it for me like I say this every time but look if you did find any value out of any of this work please hit the like button okay because it really helps

thank you as always and on behalf of block works macro my name is Weston Agmora we will see you again thank you bye"}, "podcast_summary": "In this podcast, host Weston Nakamura from Blockworks Macro discusses the recent sell-off in the NASDAQ 100 index and its connection to market forces in China. He explains how the NASDAQ 100 reached its peak and why it is currently experiencing a downturn influenced by China. Nakamura mentions the importance of Japan's equity markets in driving the NASDAQ's previous rise and how China's market movements are now pulling it down. He examines the correlation between the Nikkei 225 cash index and NDX futures, as well as the Hang Seng cash index and NDX futures, showing how movements in these indices affect the NASDAQ. Nakamura also delves into the weakening Japanese yen and how it correlates with crude oil prices and short yen trades based on Fed policies. He discusses the significance of the yen's intervention levels and the potential actions of the Japanese Ministry of Finance. Additionally, Nakamura talks about the Chinese yuan and its impact on the Hang Seng index, as well as the overall downward pressure on the NASDAQ due to China's economic situation. He explores the interplay between the Hang Seng index, dollar-yuan movements, and the flow of foreign investment in Chinese A-shares. Finally, Nakamura concludes that the NASDAQ's recent top is connected to the Hang Seng index's movements, which, in turn, are driven by China's circumstances. He advises paying attention to the Chinese currency and the Japanese stock market as they continue to influence the US stock market.", "podcast_guest": "Weston Nakamura (Blockworks Macro)", "podcast_highlights": "- NASDAQ 100 sell-off in August driven by market forces in China\n- Japan equity markets drove NASDAQ 100 rally earlier in the year\n- Japanese yen and Chinese yuan are key factors influencing market movements\n- Weak yen and strong dollar impacting yen carry trade\n- Chinese yuan stability a top priority for China\n- Hang Seng index and dollar yuan inverse chart show correlation\n- Current NASDAQ 100 downside driven by China and yuan\n- Capital flows into and out of China impacting market movements\n- Hedge funds experiencing losses in Chinese equities\n- Pay attention to Chinese currency and Japanese stock markets to understand US market movements"}
